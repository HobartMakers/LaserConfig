# Laser Config

We at Hobart Makers have a K40 laser cutter. We obtained it second hand, and it had received a series of mods and upgrades before we got it.

We intend to mod and upgrade it further - including driving it with a Raspberry Pi, GRBL Pi-Hat, and the original hard stepper drivers.

Here is a repository that can contain wiring diagrams, configuration settings, and whatever else is needed to recreate our setup.
